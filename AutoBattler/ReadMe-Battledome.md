Used to automate battledome combat against 1 hit KO enemies. You will need a 100% rate of 1 hit ko for this to be functional so you may need to decrease the difficulty of enemy of choice.

You will need to replace the following images with your own combat objects of choice by taking screenshots, saving them in this folder, then renaming the sections in the code:

6heal.jpg
8Icicle.jpg/9Meditate.jpg


You can set the iterations you'd like to run through before ending. Set to high number by default for BattleGround of the Obelisk farming.
