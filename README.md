# NP Bot

Automating portions of Neopets that I find to be boring or repetitive to make the game more enjoyable

I am primarily working on this to improve my python coding skills. This series will focus primarily on using pyautogui which is a screen based automation that will utilize your screen and mouse clicks. Obviously, this will disallow you from using your mouse, screen, and keyboard while a series is in action.

Use at your own risk.
